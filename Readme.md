# eson

  Extended JSON for node.

## Installation

```
$ npm install eson
```

## Parser

  Currently only the parser portion is implemented, useful for configuration files.
  For example a typical configuration file might look something like the following:

```js
{
  "views": "/www/example.com/views",
  "view engine": "jade",
  "poll interval": 5000,
  "canvas size": { "width": 800, "height": 600 }
}
```

 With Extended JSON you can define plugin functions, or use ones
 bundled with eson to transform the input, allowing for more
 declarative configurations as shown here:

```js
{
  "views": "{root}/views",
  "view engine": "jade",
  "poll interval": "5 seconds",
  "canvas size": "800x600"
}
```

### Writing plugins

 Writing a plugin is simple, it's a function which takes the signature `(key, val, parser)`. Let's write one that transforms every value to "foo":

```js
function foo(key, val, parser) {
  return 'foo';
}
```

 Then use the plugin like so:

```js
var eson = require('eson');

var conf = eson()
  .use(foo)
  .read('path/to/config.json');
```

 Now suppose `path/to/config.json` contained `{ "foo": "bar", "bar": "baz" }`,
 the `foo()` plugin would yield `{ "foo": "foo", "bar": "foo" }`. So you get the picture,
 with this we can accept arbitrary strings such as "5 seconds" and transform
 it to the more useful `5000` milliseconds representation.

 Many plugins may of course be used, and _all_ will be executed regardless, so if necessary
 subsequent plugins may still make modifications. Depending on what the plugins the order used _may_ have an effect on the JSON.

```js
eson()
  .use(eson.ms)
  .use(eson.include)
  .use(eson.dimensions)
  .use(eson.replace('{root}', '/www/example.com'))
  .parse('{ "interval": "15 minutes" }');
```
### eson.ms

  The milliseconds plugin supports strings like "5s", "5 seconds", "3 days", etc:
  
```js
eson()
  .use(eson.ms)
  .parse('{ "interval": "15 minutes" }');
```

yields:

```js
{ interval: 900000 }
```

### eson.include

 The include plugin allows you to literally include other JSON files. This works in
  both arrays and object literals, and loads relative to the callee's file. For example:
  
```js
eson()
  .use(eson.include)
  .parse('{ "prod": "include config/production" }');
```

yields:

```js
{ prod: { whatever: 'is', within: 'config/production.json' }}
```

 You can also include multiple files via a glob. This has a special syntax and works in one of three ways.

Consider a config folder containing the following two files:

*database.json:*
```json
{"db", "redis"}
```
*app.json:*
```json
{"listen", 3000}
```

##### Merging multiple files into one:

```js

eson()
  .use(eson.include)
  .parse('{ "prod": "include config/*" }');
```
yields:

```js
{
	prod: {
		db: "redis",
		listen: 3000
	}
}
```

##### Collect files into a map, keyed by filename:

```js

// use curly brackets to collect as a map
eson()
  .use(eson.include)
  .parse('{ "prod": "include { config/* }" }');

```

yields:


```js
{
	prod: {
		database: {
			db: "redis"
		},
		app: {
			listen: 3000
		}
	}
}

```

##### Collect files as an array:


```js

// use square brackets to collect as an array
eson()
  .use(eson.include)
  .parse('{ "prod": "include [ config/* ]" }'); 

```

yields:

```js
{
	prod: [
		{db: "redis"},
		{listen: 3000}
	]
}
```
#### Preprocessing

You can preprocess files based on file extension before including them in the JSON, just remember you must return a valid JSON value.
```js
// register a function to handle .md file content
include.extensions.md = function(fileContent) {
  var markdown = require('markdown')
  // JSON stringify ensures content is a valid JSON value
  return JSON.stringify(markdown.markdown.toHTML(fileContent))
}

eson()
  .use(eson.include)
  .parse('{ "readme": "include readme.md" }');

```

yields:

```js
{ readme: "<h1>Markdown</h1><p>Content</p>" }
```

### eson.replace(str, val)

  The replace plugin allows you to replace arbitrary substrings, useful
  for constants such as the application's root directory etc.
  
```js
eson()
  .use(eson.replace('{root}', '/www/example.com'))
  .parse('{ "upload path": "{root}/tmp" }');
```

yields:

```js
{ "upload path": "/www/example.com/tmp" }
```

### eson.glob

  The glob plugin allows you to specify glob strings, prefixed by "glob":
  
```js
eson()
  .use(eson.glob)
  .parse('{ "js": "glob public/{js,vendor}/*.js" }');
```

yields:

```js
{ js: ["public/js/app.js", "public/js/user.js", "public/vendor/jquery.js"] }
```

## moar!

  That's it for now, just experimenting with it, feel free to send me a PR
  or open and issue if you have some ideas. I'd like to keep everything
  valid JSON, for example you can use the `include` plugin to include
  env-specific config into package.json, and package.json remains a
  valid JSON document.

  For addition documentation view the [test markdown](https://github.com/visionmedia/eson/blob/master/tests.md).
